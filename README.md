# TensorFlow Serving Tutorial

This repository contains a tutorial notebook demonstrating how to use TensorFlow Serving for deploying machine learning models in a production environment. The tutorial makes use of the Fashion MNIST dataset to build a simple neural network, train it, and then serve the model using TensorFlow Serving.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
git clone https://github.com/vbabua/TF_Serving_Tutorial.git

2. **Access the Notebook on Google Colab**:  
Open `TF_Serving_Tutorial.ipynb` directly in Google Colab:

3. **Run the Notebook**:  
Execute the cells sequentially in Google Colab.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Introduction to the Fashion MNIST dataset and its preprocessing for training.

- **Model Creation and Training**: Designing a simple neural network using TensorFlow's Keras API and its training process on the Fashion MNIST dataset.

- **Model Export for TensorFlow Serving**: Procedure to save the trained model suitable for TensorFlow Serving.

- **Installing and Running TensorFlow Serving**: Steps to set up and operate TensorFlow Serving and serve the trained model.

- **Making Inference Requests**: Methodology to make requests to the served model and interpret the outcomes.
